# Metta Function Implementations  

This repository contains implementations of various functions in **Metta**. The included functions cover basic list operations and graph transformations.  

## **Features**  

### **1. List Operations**  
The following functions manipulate lists in Metta:  

- **`is-member`**: Checks whether an element is present in a list.  
- **`append`**: Adds an element to the end of a list.  
- **`max-value`**: Finds the maximum value in a list.  
- **`min-value`**: Finds the minimum value in a list.  
- **`remove-element`**: Removes a specific element from a list.  

### **2. Graph Rewriting**  
The repository also includes **graph rewriting rules** that allow transformations of  graphs.  
- Reverses directed links between nodes.  
- Removes specific edges and adds new ones as per custom transformation rules.
